Santander cycles.

Description:

This project provides a new bike system that anyone can use across London. The system includes a number of bikes and docking stations. A user can take a bike from any docking station and return it to any of the docking stations. The user will pay for the use. The system will notify when a bike needs a repair, or when a docking station is full.
